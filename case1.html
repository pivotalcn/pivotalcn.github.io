<h4>The Situation: Exploring Offline Distribution to Boost Branding and Sales</h4>
<p>A leading US groceries and food retailer encountered difficulties growing its China cross-border e-commerce business. Therefore, the client considered using offline distribution channels in addition to e-commerce, in order to strengthen its brand and increase sales in China.</h4> 
    
    <p>We were commissioned to build an actionable strategy for offline distribution. The project's main focus was to advise the client on selecting and approaching a food distributor. A secondary objective was to help the client plan the process in tackling the customs process, merchandising, and other practicalities involved in establishing an offline sales channel.</p>

  <div class="approach">
<h4>Our Approach: Clarifying the Client's Priorities and Taking a Strategic Perspective</h4>
<p>We worked with the client to clarify their needs and develop a set of criteria for choosing a food distributor. We held a workshop in which the client's relevant team discussed vague concepts and heuristics about working with "the largest" or "the most reliable" partner were discussed and articulated in concrete terms. At a strategic level, we discussed questions such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>What are the main cities targeted? Would the client prefer to start with targeting consumers in the Yangtze River Delta first? Or a distributor with presence in the 3rd and 4th tier cities be preferred?</li>
      <li>What are short-term and medium-term goals and milestones?</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
      At a practical level:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>How much marketing budget, including slotting fees and listing fees, would the client be prepared to dedicate to the launch and continued operation of an offline sales channel?</li> 
      <li>If the client were to expect the distributor to take some of the marketing responsibilities, what commitments should the client seek from the distributor?</li>
      <li>How would the client ensure that offline sales would aid instead of encroach upon the e-commerce business?</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>The workshop helped the client in aligning expectations internally. We distilled the client's need into five criteria by which we would evaluate offline distributors. The five criteria were: Size and Scale, Value Added, Partnership Mindset, Reach Into Targeted Cities, and Market Leadership.</p>

    <h4>A Practical Guide on How to Prepare for the Import and Distribution of Packaged Food from Overseas</h4>
<p>We were already familiar with the client's e-commerce business from a previous consulting engagement with the same client. For the current task of identifying a suitable distributor, we provided a step-by-step written guide tailored to the client's needs to prepare for offline distribution. </p>
    <p>The guide included practical steps such as providing a quotation to the distributor, agreeing upon trading terms and payment terms, handling product returns and recalls, and packaging and labeling requirements. Although the Chinese distributor would give further advice in the future, it was still important for the client to understand and prepare for the process. Informed by this guide, the client's internal teams were better prepared to select suitable merchandise, facilitate internal consensus-building, and refine their financial models.</p>

<h4>The Results: A Strong Position to Reach China's Major Food Distributors</h4>
<p>As a result of Pivotal's work, the client was well-positioned to meet and negotiate with their preferred China distributors. The client was ready with the necessary pricing and merchandising recommendations. We also ensured that the client had a good understanding of the complexities and investment involved in sustaining an offline distribution business model in China.</p>
