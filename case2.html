  <div class="situation">
    <h4>The Situation: Deepening China Operations Amidst Tightening Environmental Regulations</h4>
<p>A US-European chemicals company wanted to establish a new-build manufacturing facility in China. The client already has manufacturing in another Asian country where operations and labor costs are relatively high. The China market has had strong demand for the company's products, so production in China could potentially reduce logistics and customs costs.</p>
  
  <p>However, due to shifts in environmental regulations, the client encountered challenges in identifying a suitable manufacturing location. To address this issue, we were commissioned to advise on shortlisting potential Chinese partners with existing access to manufacturing facilities.</p>

<div class="approach">
<h4>Our Approach: A Systematic Process of Desk Research and Interviews with Industry Experts</h4> 

  <p>Initially, we started with a total of 16,000+ potential company names, collated through industry databases and the client's network. Through desk research and interviews, we verified the capabilities of potential partners, excluding those that are trading entities instead of manufacturing entities. Although the client was already familiar with who the industry leaders were in China, we conducted additional interviews with industry experts to learn more about reputations and competitive concerns.</p>
    
  <p>Once we reached approximately 10 to 12 potential and eligible partners, we contacted the relevant parties to gauge their interest. For those that were interested, we opened a dialogue with decision-makers within these companies, and subsequently organized calls and in-person visits for the client to meet the senior executives. For the final shortlist, the client toured the potential partnersâ€™ manufacturing plants. </p></div>

<div class="protect">
  <h4 >Protecting Sensitive Business Information, while Sharing Information and Building Rapport</h4>

  <p> A top priority in this project was protecting the client&#39;s interest and safeguarding any sensitive information, as the client possessed several sought-after materials technologies. We were careful to facilitate communication and in-person meetings between the client and interested parties such that strategies were discussed and an appropriate level of information was shared. However, no sensitive business information was leaked, neither from the client side nor from interested parties.</p>

 <div class="results">
<h4>The Result: Insights about the China Market Led to a New Strategic Direction</h4>
   
   <p>Through this project, the client gained new insights about the China market, industry structure, and its current competitors. The client met several potential partners in person; these were Chinese companies either in the same industry or in the value chain. Through the dialogue, the client gained practical, hands-on understanding about the evolving environmental and climate change regulations and the implications for a joint venture or collaboration in China. In addition, these new insights enabled the client to update its cost models for running manufacturing, logistics, and raw materials import. </p>
   
<p>Eventually, the client decided against setting up manufacturing in China, and has continued to rely on its Asian manufacturing plant to serve Chinese demand. Instead, the client boosted expanded its southern China-based marketing team and launched proactive, multichannel B2B marketing campaigns.</p>
